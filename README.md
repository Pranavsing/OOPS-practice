Here are some OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) coding problems that cover various OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and more.

### 1. **Library Management System**
   - **Problem**: Design a `Library` class that can store details of books (`Book` class). The library should allow adding books, removing books, and displaying book details. The `Book` class should contain attributes like `title`, `author`, and `ISBN`.
   - **Concepts**: Encapsulation, Aggregation
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a `Book` class with private attributes and getter/setter methods.
     - Create a `Library` class with methods to add and remove books.
     - Implement a method to display all books in the library.

### 2. **Bank Account System**
   - **Problem**: Design a `BankAccount` class with attributes `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, and `balance`. Implement methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. Then create derived classes for `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount`.
   - **Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement the base class `BankAccount`.
     - Create `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` classes that inherit from `BankAccount`.
     - Override the `withdraw` method in `SavingsAccount` to check for a minimum balance.

### 3. **Shape Area Calculation**
   - **Problem**: Create a base class `Shape` with a method `area()` that returns 0. Create derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override the `area()` method to return the area of the circle and rectangle respectively.
   - **Concepts**: Polymorphism (Method Overriding), Inheritance
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define a `Shape` class with a virtual method `area()`.
     - Implement the `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes with appropriate attributes and methods.
     - Demonstrate polymorphism by creating an array of `Shape` pointers.

### 4. **Movie Ticket Booking System**
   - **Problem**: Implement a `Movie` class with attributes like `title`, `genre`, and `rating`. Create a `Booking` class that holds booking details like `movie`, `seats`, and `time`. Implement methods to book tickets, cancel bookings, and display booking details.
   - **Concepts**: Encapsulation, Association
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define a `Movie` class and a `Booking` class.
     - Create methods in the `Booking` class for booking and canceling tickets.
     - Store multiple `Booking` instances and display the booking summary.

### 5. **Employee Management System**
   - **Problem**: Create a base class `Employee` with attributes like `name`, `id`, and `salary`. Derive two classes `Manager` and `Developer` from `Employee` with specific attributes like `teamSize` for `Manager` and `programmingLanguage` for `Developer`.
   - **Concepts**: Inheritance, Encapsulation
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement getter and setter methods for all attributes.
     - Create objects of `Manager` and `Developer` and display their details.
     - Implement a method to calculate bonuses based on role.

### 6. **E-commerce Product System**
   - **Problem**: Design a class `Product` with attributes like `productId`, `name`, and `price`. Create derived classes `Electronics`, `Clothing`, and `Grocery` with specific attributes. Implement methods for applying discounts based on product type.
   - **Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a base `Product` class and derived classes.
     - Implement discount logic in each derived class.
     - Demonstrate polymorphic behavior by storing different product types in a single collection.

### 7. **Student Report Card System**
   - **Problem**: Implement a `Student` class with attributes `name`, `rollNumber`, and a list of `marks`. Create methods to calculate the average, highest, and lowest marks. Create a method to print the report card.
   - **Concepts**: Encapsulation, Abstraction
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define the `Student` class and encapsulate the marks list.
     - Implement methods to add marks, calculate the average, and print the report card.
     - Ensure marks are in a valid range (0-100).

### 8. **Zoo Management System**
   - **Problem**: Create an abstract class `Animal` with methods `eat()` and `sleep()`. Derive classes like `Lion`, `Elephant`, and `Monkey` from `Animal` and implement the methods. Add additional behaviors like `roar()` for `Lion`.
   - **Concepts**: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create the abstract `Animal` class and derived classes.
     - Override the `eat()` and `sleep()` methods in each derived class.
     - Demonstrate the use of a base class pointer to call derived class methods.

### 9. **Online Shopping Cart**
   - **Problem**: Create a `Product` class and a `Cart` class. The `Cart` class should manage a list of products with methods to add products, remove products, and display the total price. Implement encapsulation to manage the list of products privately.
   - **Concepts**: Encapsulation, Aggregation
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define `Product` and `Cart` classes.
     - Implement methods to manage products in the cart.
     - Create a method to display the cart summary and total cost.

### 10. **Vehicle Rental System**
   - **Problem**: Design a base class `Vehicle` with derived classes `Car`, `Bike`, and `Bus`. Each class should have methods to calculate rental cost based on distance and time. Implement a method to display details of the rental.
   - **Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define the `Vehicle` base class and derived classes.
     - Override the rental calculation method in each derived class.
     - Demonstrate polymorphism using an array of `Vehicle` pointers.

These problems can be solved in C++, Java, Python, or any other OOP-supported language. Let me know if you need specific solutions or hints for any of these problems!
